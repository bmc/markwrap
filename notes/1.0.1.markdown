* Bumped the WikiText `textile-core` version to 1.4 and the `pegdown`
  version to 1.2.1. Thanks to Ricky Elrod (*ricky.gh* at *elrod.me*) for
  the update.
* Compiles against Scala 2.10.1 now (which should be bytecode-compatible with
  prior Scala 2.10 releases).
* Bumped ScalaTest version to 2.0.M5b.
